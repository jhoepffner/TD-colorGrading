# TD-colorGrading
There is a first attempt to build a real-time color grading tool for TouchDesigner
Inspired by daVinci Resolve with some code coming from different part (credit are in the glsl shader).
There is much work to do:
- normalize the numbers
- a reset for everything
- some preset and recording
- some damping in the movement
But it is a begining, sort of version 0.1...
Feel free to comment and upgrade.
